          Consumer perceptions about a brand are not shaped merely by its product offerings or advertisements. In today’s digital 
          world, a company’s website and social media channels also play a crucial role in determining consumer perceptions and their
           buying behaviour. Your website is usually the first point of contact for your audience. Thus, you want to be spending time
            and energy on it to ensure that your potential
           customers develop a positive image of your brand or product <br /> <br />
          Content truly is king and if marketed in the right way, it can get your brand and business the traction it deserves.
           Along with text and static images, 
          videos and GIFs have now become the most popular content formats.
